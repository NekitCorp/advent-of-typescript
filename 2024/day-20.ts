/**
 * **Variable Scope Analysis: ðŸŽ©Bernard's New Demands**
 *
 * After discovering the elves' code automation scheme, ðŸŽ©Bernard was... impressed! But now he's sending it back along with every lazy elf's worst nightmare: more work...
 *
 * [ðŸŽ©Bernard] This is a good start, but we need to track which variables are actually being used. We can't have unused variables cluttering up our toy production scripts - who knows what kind of bugs that could cause!
 *
 * The elves need to enhance their code analyzer to track both declared variables AND their usage. For each script, they need to report:
 * - All variables that are declared (using `let`, `const`, or `var`)
 * - All variables that are actually used (as function arguments)
 *
 * For example, when analyzing:
 * ```ts
 * let robotDog = "deluxe_model";
 * assembleToy(robotDog);
 * ```
 *
 * The analyzer should produce:
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   declared: ["robotDog"],
 *   used: ["robotDog"]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * And if variables are declared but never used (like in `let teddyBear = "standard_model";`), they should only appear in the `declared` array, not the `used` array.
 *
 * Implement a type `AnalyzeScope` that performs this analysis, handling:
 * - Variable declarations with any amount of whitespace
 * - Function calls with variable references
 * - Multiple declarations and usages in the same script
 * - Empty or whitespace-only scripts
 *
 * Hint
 *
 * Consider breaking down the analysis into two parts: one for gathering declarations and another for finding usages. Remember that variables can be declared without being used, and whitespace can appear anywhere!
