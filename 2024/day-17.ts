/**
 * **Mind Control Is Surprisingly Effective**
 *
 * [ðŸŽ…Santa was the victim of a magical mind-control potion, prepared by his own Mrs. Claus: ðŸ’‹Crystal Claus. It's the next morning and ðŸŽ…Santa is just walking into the break room where all the reindeer were preparing for the day's chores.]
 *
 * [ðŸŽ…Santa] My dear wonderful reindeer! How truly magnificent you all are! I don't do enough to show my appreciation for you!
 *
 * [ðŸ”´Rudolph] Um. Are you feeling ok? Also, if the answer is "yes", you better not be about to give us $15 starbucks gift cards again as our "big bonus this season".
 *
 * [ðŸŽ…Santa] ðŸ”´Rudolph, ðŸ”´Rudolph, sweet ðŸ”´Rudolph. I have had an awakening! It actually is $15 dollars! But it's a $15 dollar per hour salary increase for every reindeer!!
 *
 * [Silence. Utter silence in the room. The reindeer are in shock. Several long moments pass. The reindeer are expecting ðŸŽ…Santa to laugh in their faces and say it's all a joke...]
 *
 * [ðŸŽ…Santa] draw up some composable contracts! I'll sign them all today!
 *
 * You heard him! We need to make a general purpose `compose` function. This particular (simplified) function just takes functors, and returns the result of calling each, passing the result of the previous.
 *
 * Hint
 *
 * Think through the problem step by step, as if you were calling `h(g(f(a)))` in your own code. Start by individually typing all of the helper functions, then once you feel confident about those, work up from there. Don't forget about the `intrinsic` builtins!
