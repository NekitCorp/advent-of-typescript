/**
 * **ðŸŽ©Bernard's Long List Of Names**
 *
 * [Things are staring to heat up in the North Pole. The reindeer have been blackmailing Mrs. Claus in order to get fair pay, threatening to expose her affair with ðŸª©Jamie Glitterglum.]
 *
 * [ðŸŽ…Santa] GET ME THOSE NAMES!!!!!!!!!!
 *
 * [ðŸŽ©Bernard] I'm workin' on it, I'm workin' on it!
 *
 * [ðŸŽ…Santa] TODAY! I NEED THEM TODAY!! ACTUALLY I NEED THEM LAST MONTH!!!
 *
 * [ðŸŽ…Santa throws a giant box of delicate glass Christmas tree ornaments against the factory wall, sending shards of glass flying in every direction]
 *
 * [ðŸŽ©Bernard] Ah, there's the classic ðŸŽ…Santa we all know and love. Smashing priceless ornaments while screaming unintelligibly. Truly, the Christmas spirit personified.
 *
 * [ðŸŽ…Santa] TODAY! I NEED THEM TODAY!! ACTUALLY I NEED THEM LAST MONTH!!!
 *
 * [ðŸŽ©Bernard] You want every name? Fine. I'll even get you the ones with seven middle initials and the kids named after TikTok trends.
 *
 * ðŸŽ©Bernard has a very long list of names from the Social Security Administration, but we need to format the data into objects so ðŸŽ…Santa can ingest it into his existing system.
 *
 * Help ðŸŽ©Bernard before ðŸŽ…Santa continues his violent tirade.
 *
 * Help ðŸŽ©Bernard before ðŸŽ…Santa continues his violent tirade. He's not about to spend a bunch of time looking at each child so instead he's just deciding whether a child is naughty or nice based on the number of characters in their name!
 *
 * A HUGE hint
 *
 * Part of the fun/trick of this challenge is that you can't solve it normally by iterating because you'll get:
 * - `Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.ts(2589)`
 * - `Type produces a tuple type that is too large to represent.ts(2799)`
 *
 * For example, many people will probably first try:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export type Solution<
 *   Row extends [string, string, string][],
 *   Accumulator extends { name: string, count: number}[] = []
 * > =
 *   Row extends [
 *     [infer Name extends string, string, infer Count],
 *     ...infer Rest extends Row,
 *   ]
 *   ? Solution<
 *       Rest,
 *       [
 *         ...Accumulator,
 *         {
 *           name: Name,
 *           count: Count extends `${infer CountNum extends number}` ? CountNum : never
 *         }
 *       ]
 *     >
 *   : Accumulator;
 * ```
 *
 * or the non tail-call recursive version:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export type Solution<
 *   Row extends [string, string, string][],
 * > =
 *   Row extends [
 *     [infer Name extends string, string, infer Count],
 *     ...infer Rest extends Row,
 *   ]
 *   ? [
 *       {
 *         name: Name,
 *         count: Count extends `${infer CountNum extends number}` ? CountNum : never
 *       },
 *       ...Solution<Rest>
 *     ]
 *   : [];
 * ```
 *
 * but that won't work at these scales. You need to find another way to iterate the array that doesn't involve recursion.
